# COSC-2030-SP25-Linked-Lists

Predict and Run:  Examine the class definition and how that class is both used in the main file and how the pointers relate to each other.  I go over this in the weekly video a bit, as well as what the book provides.  Make some predictions on the order of how the values will print in the main method.

Investigate:  Here we will add one more value to the end of the chain and examine how the rest of the code remains the same.

Modify:  In this very similar file, we will have you create one more value at the end. You'll need to create a new node object and call the Insert After method to build this at the end.

Make:  Insert an item, much like what happened in the Modify part of the video (and file), but this will insert an item after the first item instead of at the end.

The whole point of this is to do this after the main chain of link lists has been created. You are to insert the new item in between existing items, not at the end.  Do not just put the statements in a new order to get the output to look right.  The code that inserts the item that will end up being in the second position should be the last code called as far as inserting is concerned.  

Turn in all of the files necessary to run your code in a zip file and submit that to this assignment page.
